# LinkedIn OSINT

The term LION stands for Linkedin Open Networker, which means a person who wants to expand their Linkedin network and has a high number of connections.



As you may know, Linkedin users can have three degrees of connection:

* 1st connections – your connections, people you’re directly connected with
* 2nd connections – people that you’re not directly connected with, but your connections are connected with them; 1st-degree connections of your connections
* 3rd connections -people that are connections of your 2nd-degree connections
